# 我们的价值观 ([English](#our-values))

>  如果你想走得快，一个人走; 如果你想走得远，一群人走

我们不想做一个封闭的系统，为某一款或几款硬件，做一个定制化的解决方案，然后去兜售它，并宣称我们是最好的解决方案。

我们相信创意来自广泛的连接和分享。如果某一天在这个领域出现了一些振奋人心的东西，我相信它会首先出现在社区。

我们喜欢Scratch积木化的界面，喜欢它的口号

>  Imagine, Program, Share

我们喜欢media lab提出的4P方法:

>  项目（Projects）、同伴（Peers）、热情（Passion）、玩耍（Play）

我们想让Scratch3.0能连接到更广阔的世界,以便让参与项目的你也能与这个现实世界建立广泛的连接，而不只是生活在虚拟的空间中。我们希望你将编程创造的东西，用到日常中，给大家带来欢乐和惊喜。我们想把任何有趣的东西接入进来，以便打造[更宽的围墙和更高的天花板](https://blog.just4fun.site/scratch.html)，当然，也包括接入你童年的那辆玩具四驱车

我们想为你打造一个"绿洲"，我们想

>  创造出一个不可思议的、美丽的、夺人心魄的场所,在那里人们可以漫步,可以梦想,历经很多世纪生生不息

但遗憾的是我们没有这个能力，我们最终只是打造一个通用的插件系统，而把更多的可能性留给了你自己，我们希望你能参与进来一起来改进它。这意味着如果你想连接你喜欢的东西，你不能坐着等我们来帮你。不过我们将尽最大努力给你提供一个好用的工具

>  学习是必须亲力亲为的，教育则是外界加诸你身上的

你需要自己动起手来,去创造你所向往的东西。

这和生活不是很像么？

世界如果存在什么边界的话，可能只有想象力

有趣的东西现在还不多，在这个领域，除了富有远见的Jean Piaget、Alan Curtis Kay、Seymour Papert和Mitchel Resnick曾做过令人振奋的探索。当前的很多项目，说实话，让人有点瞌睡

我们想与你，以及广阔的社区(我们正在构建它)，一起动起手来做些真正令人振奋的东西

Just for fun :)

# Our Values 

>  If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

We don't want to do something like this: build a closed system, make it customized for a couple of hardware, then peddle it and declare it as our best solution.

We believe creativity comes from broad connections and sharing. If something truly exciting comes out, we believe it must appear in our community at first place.

We are fond of Scratch's block-like interface and its idea:

>  Imagine, Program, Share

We also like the vision of Media Lab for learning:

> Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play.

We are trying to make Scratch 3.0 connect to a bigger world, which would make it easier for the creators(that's you!) to connect with our real world, not just within the virtual space. We hope the things you create will bring a ton of surprise and joy to your family and friends. To build a broader wall and a higher ceiling, we want to bring in every interesting things we found,  which includes your Mini-4WD from childhood for sure.

We want to create a oasis for you,

> That one day, somewhere, somehow, we shall build one building which is wonderful, beautiful, breathtaking, a place where people can walk and dream for centuries.

Unfortunately, we don't have that power yet. We will eventually build a general plug-in system, and leave more space and possibility for you. We hope you to join us and improve it. This means, if you want the system connect to something you like, you cannot just sit around wait for us to help build it. Instead, we will try out best to provide you some great tools and utilities.

> Education is what people do to you. Learning is what you do to yourself.

To create something promising, you have to get your hands dirty.

Isn't it just like our life?

The only boundary that our world might have, is our imagination.

Except those exceptional work from visionary Jean Piaget, Alan Curtis Kay, Seymour Papert and Mitchel Resnick, there're not many interesting things in this area yet. To be honest, a lot of current projects are kind of boring.

That's why we want you, along with the promising community that we are building, to do  some great things together.

Just for fun!
